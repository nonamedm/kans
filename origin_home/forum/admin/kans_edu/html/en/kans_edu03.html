											At the time when the X-ray was discovered by Konrad Roentgen and Madam Curie, the risks involved with X-rays were not well known. Madam Curie died of leukemia in 1934, following exposure to radiation and the serious side-effects associated with radiation. It has been suggested however, that her death may have been caused by occupational radiation exposure.

                                            When exposed to radiation individuals may be harmed in accordance with the relevant exposure dose. The most sensitive tissue is homeopathic organ tissue. Distinct acute changes occur in the number of white blood cells (WBC’s) due to the corresponding dose. Reproductive organs are also sensitive and may lose their function or even fail based on the level of the corresponding dose. Even though skin is not as sensitive, it may also be damaged in specific regions exposed to a higher dose. Two typical radiological effects are well-known and understood. They are the deterministic effect and stochastic effect.

                                            Alpha rays; Usually the shielding of alpha particles is not necessary, as they float 2 to 3 cm in the air. However, it is important to protect against internal contamination by alpha emitters, as they are much more risky than other radiation emitters. In this case, protection of internal radiation exposure is more important than that of external radiation exposure.

                                            Beta rays; It is necessary to shield moderate or strong energy-beta rays, excluding the weak energy ones. Glass, wood, plastic, aluminum, etc. are suitable shielding materials for beta rays.

                                            Gamma rays; Since gamma rays are penetrating, it is better to shield against them with moderately thick materials such as concrete or lead. Calculations of adequate shielding material thickness would be especially helpful for ensuring workplace safety. Shielding of X rays may be done in a similar fashion.

                                                When radiation exposure dose is insufficiently low at a working station utilizing shielding and distance only, the length of contact time at a relevant position should be minimized. It is essential to wear protective clothing and use various safety related tools. If many workers are available, team shift systems may be utilized to keep the individual dose limits to a minimum.

                                                2) Dilution of Radioactive Concentrates
                                                <p class="art06">
                                                    A complete containment of radioactive materials is difficult to achieve and often radioactive surface contamination occurs. When surface contamination has occurred, subsequent air contamination is difficult to avoid. Safety management of contaminated surfaces and air is essential to protect against internal contamination of radioactivity. Materials removed from the control area should be decontaminated in advance, to prevent contamination of the surroundings of the control area. When considering these processes, dilution of the radioactive concentrates, or the handling of a small amount of radioactivity is most desirable.

                                                <p class="art06">
                                                     In circumstances where general safety in the work place environment is difficult, it is important to devise counter-measures which block intake routes of radioactive materials. The most commonly known intake routes of radioactive materials are via respiratory and digestive organs, wounds, the skin, etc. Accordingly, wearing a gas mask, and following the four prohibitive considerations of, no smoking, no eating, no drinking, and no make-up or cosmetics, should be implemented strictly. By wearing protective equipment and gloves we can protect ourselves against radioactive materials from entering via a wound or through skin penetration.

Local residents or on-site visitors should follow the guidance provided by safety professionals. General methods of coping with nuclear power plant accidents are similar to those learned in safety training and emergency exercises which have already been implemented and practiced by the nuclear safety authority.

                                                There are some precedent examples of radiation accidents available and documented where a radiation source material, such as an object used by a radiographer has been lost. Whenever an unfamiliar object is found on or around the site it should be reported to the police and related authorities. These days, most people are aware of the radiation warning mark normally attached to the containers of radioactive sources. Due to the fact that the radioactivity of the radiography source is high, it is the owner's responsibility to report this to the safety authority promptly whenever he or she has lost an item or source of radiation. Additionally, a lost item or source is usually repossessed with the help of media announcements or social network systems.

Specifics regarding the accident including, the date, time and location of the accident, as well as the names of the injured individuals, and any other details should be included in outline of the accident report. Secondly, injured individuals must be transferred to a secure location in accordance with the guidance suggested by the radiation safety officer.

                                            <p class="art06">
                                                In the case of an NPP accident, radioactive contamination is the main reason for the evacuation of surrounding residents. If a radioactive contamination accident has occurred near a residence, it is suggested that individuals remain at home, keeping all doors and windows closed to prevent radioactive contaminants from entering their residence. The method of coping with this type of situation is similar to that for the prevention of fine yellow dust from entering into a household. If leaving your residence is unpreventable, individuals should wear protective clothing, rubber gloves, rubber shoes, 24 a gas mask, a cap, and carry an umbrella to not prevent getting wet by potentially contaminated rainfall. Upon returning home, individuals should immediately take a shower to remove any contaminants which may have came into contact with his or her body or clothing. Residents must always pay strict attention to information from safety related organizations ensuring that tap water is not contaminated with any radioactivity. Prior to cooking, all food items should be well washed with uncontaminated water. In addition to the methods of coping with contamination which have been described above, there are some other general rules to follow

In the case of a fire, fire-fighting at the initial stage is very important, as is the prevention of the fire spreading.
